# Blinkit-Product-Analysis-
Blinkit, a reputed online grocery store, harnesses the power of data 
analysis using Tableau to make informed, data-driven decisions. They 
utilize Tableau to track sales trends, analyze customer behavior, and 
identify areas for improvement. With Tableau, they can analyze sales 
data for specific product categories and compare sales figures across 
different outlets to pinpoint areas that require focused efforts for 
increasing sales. 
In the case study titled "Blinkit: Grocery Product Analysis," a dataset 
called 'Grocery Sales' contains 12 columns with information on sales of 
grocery items across different outlets.
The table Grocery Sales is a .CSV file and has the following columns, 
details of which are as follows: 
 Item_Identifier: A unique ID for each product in the dataset. 
 Item_Weight: The weight of the product. 
 Item_Fat_Content: Indicates whether the product is low fat or 
not. 
 Item_Visibility: The percentage of the total display area in the 
store that is allocated to the specific product. 
 Item_Type: The category or type of product. 
 Item_MRP: The maximum retail price (list price) of the product. 
 Outlet_Identifier: A unique ID for each store in the dataset. 
 Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which the store was 
established. 
 Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area 
covered. 
 Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city or region in which the 
store is located. 
 Outlet_Type: Indicates whether the store is a grocery store or a 
supermarket. 
 Item_Outlet_Sales: The sales of the product in the particular 
store. This is the outcome variable that we want to predict.
